# sbt-catalysts

Sbt plugin for catalysts-like projects. 

## Usage


To use it, just add it to your `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.github.inthenow" % "sbt-catalysts" % "0.1.5")
```

This will automatically:
- Include other plugins - see [the build file for the current list](https://github.com/InTheNow/sbt-catalysts/blob/master/build.sbt#L14-L26)
- Include some functionality to help keep your build file sane - see [the activator template build file for an example](https://github.com/InTheNow/activator-catalysts/blob/master/build.sbt)

For a new project, consider using [the activator template](https://github.com/InTheNow/activator-catalysts)
